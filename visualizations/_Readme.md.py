# MAGIC Analytics is about telling a powerful story. Visuals, charts, graphs are a key aspect of telling that story to a wide audience. There are a plethora of Python packages that help data scientists, data engineers and business analysist turn data into information and understanding.
# MAGIC This series will explore strategies for building portable Python based visuals compatible with the wide range of popular Python data visualization packages.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC There are a zoo of powerful Python visualization packages and it's not obvious how to port those packages to Databricks notebooks or how to run them at scale in a headless manner.

# MAGIC This series of Databricks notebooks demonstrate how to run popular 3rd party charting packages on Databricks using display() and displayHTML() capabilities. There are several tricks employed to port IPython based visuals to Databricks, including the use of in-memory image generation, exploiting lesser known HTML and SVG renderers.
